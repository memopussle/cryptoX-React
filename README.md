KryptoX is a website for crypto enthusiasts - it displays all of the latest information about crypto, trending NFTs and daily News from the world of crypto. With KryptoX, you won't miss out on market trends, price changes and general updates.



### Built With

I primarily utilised these technologies to build this project: React and JavaScript. I used RTK Query method from Redux Toolkit to simplify the existing data fetching logic and Sass to write CSS styles faster. Also, I implemented a few small npm packages such as hover-effect, chart.js and millify to achieve distortion effects and to enhance the overall design.

        <li><p>Display the latest cryptocurrency markets, news and top selling NFTs</p></li>
  </ol>


### Challenges

Redux toolkit was not easy to learn at first but then I became familiar with it quicker than I thought I would. I ensured I knew the basics and foundation first and continued to build on my knowledge of the library as my project progressed. I am sastisfied at what I have accomplished, but in the future, I would love to add some animations to this project, add a support page and link it to Stripe for payment. Also, I think it would be a good idea to integrate a live help and crypto consulting service.
